# AcreetionOS Linux Number 1
# copyright 2025
Welcome to AcreetionOS Linux, an open-source project aimed at providing the user a stable and up-to-date experience.

Download ISO here: https://acreetionos.org

## Project Overview

AcreetionOS Linux is a community-driven effort to build a lightweight, versatile Linux distribution. AcreetionOS Linux is currently based on Arch Linux, but the future goal is to be a parallel* distribution with our own base. Our goal is to provide a solid foundation for both everyday users and developers, with a focus on simplicity, ease of use, and stability; all while keeping packages up to date.

## Features

- Lightweight base system
- Standardized Package Selection
- User-friendly installation process
- x86_64 friendly.

## Getting Started

To get started with AcreetionOS Linux, you can:

1. Download the latest ISO from our [Website](https://acreetionos.org)!
2. Create a bootable USB drive using tools like [Etcher]("https://etcher.balena.io/#download-etcher"), [Rufus]("https://rufus.ie/en/"), or [Ventoy]("https://ventoy.net/en/index.html").
3. Boot from the USB drive and follow the installation instructions

*     Ventoy MUST use GRUB MODE 2, if you use grub by its self will not boot correctly if at all.*
